# ML701_semi_supervised_learning
Semi supervised learning project for ML-701

There are three different modules in the repository - Self-Training, Spectral Graph Convolution, and Deep Generative Models.

To reproduce the plots in the self-training section of the report, run the selfTraining notebook. It calls the self-training models and initializes the base classifiers within the code. There are different sections of the code to produce different plots. Select the code section that pertains to a specific plot accordingly.

To reproduce the results of the spectral graph convolutional network model, you must run the graph_convolutional_model_mnist jupyter notebook in the order provided. The plots are provided at the end of the notebook.
